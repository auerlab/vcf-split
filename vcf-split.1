.SH "PURPOSE"

.B vcf-split
efficiently splits a multi-sample VCF stream into single-sample VCF files.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"

Previous methods for splitting a multi-sample VCF stream into single-sample
files involved rereading the multi-sample input for every sample.  This can
become a major bottleneck where there are many samples and/or the input
is compressed.  For example, merely decoding one human chromosome BCF with
137,000 samples and dumping the VCF output to /dev/null took 11 hours on a
fast server using 2 cores.  To split it into 137,000 single-sample VCFs
would therefore require at least 137,000 * 11 * 2 = ~3 million core-hours
on an HPC cluster.

.B vcf-split
solves this problem by writing a large number of single-sample VCFs
simultaneously during a single read of the multi-sample input.  The number
of parallel output files is limited only by the open file limit of your
system, which is typically at least in the tens of thousands on a modern
Unix workstation or server.

.B vcf-split does not inhale large amounts of data into RAM, so memory
use is trivial and it runs mostly from cache, making it very fast.

The example BCF file mentioned above can be split in about 33 hours using
three runs of about 45,000 output files each.
